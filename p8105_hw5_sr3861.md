### Problem 2: Washington Post Homicides Data

``` r
#Read in data from github
homicides = read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv') %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state)
  )
```

The raw data set has *52179* observations of *13* variables. It contains
data on homicides, with variables such as reported date, victim’s name,
race/age/sex, disposition, city and state.

Summary of Unsolved Homicides:

``` r
homicides %>%
  filter(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest")%>%
  group_by(city_state, disposition)%>%
  count() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### Problem 3: Power in a 1-sample t-test

n = 30 sigma = 5 mu = 0

Generate 5000 datasets from the model: x \~ Normal\[mu, sigma\]:

``` r
#create function
sim_mean_pval = function(n, mu, sigma) {
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma),
  )
  
  sim_data %>% 
    summarize(
      mu_hat = mean(x),
      t.test(x, mu = mu, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.95) %>%
        broom::tidy() %>%
        select(p.value)
    )
}

#run function 5000 times and save results to a list
output = vector("list", 100)

for (i in 1:100) {
  output[[i]] = sim_mean_pval(n = 30, mu = 0, sigma = 5)
}

sim_results = bind_rows(output)
```

Repeat the above for mu = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

``` r
#create a dataframe with all the outputs
t_test_stats =
tibble(
  mu = c(1:6)
) %>%
  mutate(
    stats = map(.x = mu, ~rerun(100, sim_mean_pval(n = 30, mu = .x, sigma = 5)))
  ) %>%
unnest(stats) %>%
unnest(stats)
```

*Plot proportion of times null was rejected vs. mu*

``` r
t_test_stats %>%
  mutate(
  reject = (p.value < 0.05)) %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
    summarize(
    power = sum(reject)/length(p.value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = power)) + geom_line() +
  xlab("True Mean")+
  ylab("Test Power")
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_sr3861_files/figure-gfm/plot power-1.png" width="90%" />

*Plot the average estimate of μ^ on the y axis and the true value of μ
on the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average
estimate of μ^ only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y
axis and the true value of μ on the x axis.*

``` r
plot_mu_hat = 
  t_test_stats %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
  summarize(avg_mu_hat = mean(mu_hat))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = avg_mu_hat)) + geom_line() +
  xlab("True Mean")+
  ylab("Average Estimate of Mu Hat")

plot_rejected = 
  t_test_stats %>%
  mutate(
  reject = (p.value < 0.05)) %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
  filter(reject == TRUE)%>%
  summarize(
    avg_reject = mean(mu_hat))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = avg_reject)) + geom_line() +
  xlab("True Mean")+
  ylab("Average Estimate of Mu Hat Where Null is Rejected")

plot_mu_hat + plot_rejected
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_sr3861_files/figure-gfm/plot mu hat-1.png" width="90%" />

*Is the sample average of μ hat across tests for which the null is
rejected approximately equal to the true value of μ? Why or why not?*

ANSWER: Yes, the sample avergae is approximately equal to the true mean
even when the null is rejected. This is because all the data was
ultimately created from the same distribution with the same mean. The
range of values of the estimate of mu hat is much larger when the null
is rejected, but the mean value will still be the same.
